# Security Policy

Mailuminati Guardian is a security focused project.
We take vulnerability reports seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do NOT open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately to the maintainers.

### How to Report

  OR
- Contact the maintainers through the Mailuminati organization

Please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigations, if available

- Default configurations
- Public APIs exposed by Guardian

Out of scope:

## Disclosure Process

## Philosophy

Guardian prioritizes:

- Minimizing attack surface

- Failing safely

Security reports that help reinforce these goals are always welcome.
